**Disadvantages of ACID Properties in DBMS**
_Performance Overhead:_ ACID properties can introduce performance costs, especially when enforcing isolation between transactions or ensuring atomicity.
_Complexity:_ Maintaining ACID properties in distributed systems (like microservices or cloud environments) can be complex and may require sophisticated solutions like distributed locking or transaction coordination.
_Scalability Issues:_ ACID properties can pose scalability challenges, particularly in systems with high transaction volumes, where traditional relational databases may struggle under load.

**Critical Use Cases for ACID in Databases**
In modern applications, ensuring the reliability and consistency of data is crucial. ACID properties are fundamental in sectors like:

_Banking:_ Transactions involving money transfers, deposits, or withdrawals must maintain strict consistency and durability to prevent errors and fraud.
_E-commerce:_ Ensuring that inventory counts, orders, and customer details are handled correctly and consistently, even during high traffic, requires ACID compliance.
_Healthcare:_ Patient records, test results, and prescriptions must adhere to strict consistency, integrity, and security standards.
